Simple extension of the zoom levels in the game Star Valor.

It adds a couple of zoom levels above of the existing ones.

**NOTE:** On the higher levels the names for entities disappear ☹️

Installing Plugins
---
This mod requires the BepInEx mod framework.
Install the latest (x86) release, see here for instructions: [BepinEx](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html)

**Important**: Star Valor is a 32-bit/(x86) application. Make sure you choose the 32-bit/(x86) version of BepinEx.

After installing BepInEx, download the latest release of the plugin (the .dll file) and put it in the BepInEx/plugins folder inside of your Star Valor game directory.

* As with all mods, make sure to **back up your save game** before trying a new mod.
* Only download mods from reliable sources: as with everything on the internet, be careful.

After installing, if your mods don't work, try the following:
> Navigate to the where you installed BepinEx, and open doorstop_config.ini with a text editor  
> Change "ignoreDisableSwitch=false" to "ignoreDisableSwitch=true"
